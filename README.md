Implementing inference methods for Latent Dirichlet Allocation model. This repo is for study purposes.

The purpose of this repository is to serve as a study material for those interested in learning and coding inference methods for probabilistic models. As a case study, we will focus on the Dirichlet Allocation model proposed by [Blei et. al 
(2003)](http://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume3/blei03a/blei03a.pdf).

We will be implementing the following inference methods:

- [ ] MCMC
- [ ] Gibbs sampling
- [ ] Collapsed Gibbs sampling
- [ ] Variational Inference
